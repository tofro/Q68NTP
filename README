Q68NTP
-------

An NTP client for the Q68

More of a demo on how to write network clients in assembly than an actual program - But it's still useful!

Adapt to your likings (time zone, summer time, timeouts,...) using config or menuconfig

Minimal functionality: Simply asks the time server for the time, retrieves it and sets the internal clock (NOT the RTC!), 
ignoring all sub-seconds and round-trip delays. 
If you want the RTC's clock to be set, simply run one of the proper utilities afterwards.
